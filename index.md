Welcome to my personal webpage!

My name is Manuele Bazzichetto, I am from Rome (Italy), and I am a vegetation ecologist broadly interested in biological invasions, biogeography, species distribution modelling, and, from recently, on the effect of climatic anomalies on ecosystem stability. Here is a picture of me (when I had long hairs  :smile: ):

At the moment, I am a visiting researcher at [CIDE](https://www.csic.es/en/investigacion/institutos-centros-y-unidades/desertification-research-centre) where I am collaborating with Francesco de Bello in investigating how central European grasslands respond to extreme climatic conditions (e.g. drought). 

From October 2022, I will be a MSCA fellow at the Czech University of Life Sciences, wehere I will be investigating with [Petr Keil](https://petrkeil.github.io/website//) how extreme climatic events affect the temporal stability of vegetation communities! Our project is named COCOS (effects of Climatic extremes On eCOsystem Stability), and I will be soon posting news and info about it. 

A few words about what I like: stats, spatial analysis, coding in R, and creating maps (see an example here [LOTVS map](https://manuelebazzichetto.github.io/LOTVS_MAP/)).
