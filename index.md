Welcome to my personal webpage!

My name is Manuele Bazzichetto, I am from Rome (Italy), and I am a vegetation ecologist broadly interested in biological invasions, biogeography, species distribution modelling. Here is a picture of me (when I had long hairs  :smile: ):

At the momemnt, I am a visiting researcher at CIDE [https://www.csic.es/en/investigacion/institutos-centros-y-unidades/desertification-research-centre](https://www.csic.es/en/investigacion/institutos-centros-y-unidades/desertification-research-centre) where I am collaborating with Francesco de Bello for investigating how central European grasslands respond to extreme climatic conditions. 

I like stats, spatial analysis and creating maps, see an example here: [LOTVS map](https://manuelebazzichetto.github.io/LOTVS_MAP/).
