Welcome to my personal webpage (**still under construction** :hammer: )

My name is Manuele Bazzichetto, and I am a vegetation ecologist broadly interested in:
- biological invasions
- biogeography
- species distribution modelling.

Here a picture of me (when I had long hairs  :smile: ):

As soon as I can, I will share on this web-site all things related to my research and personal interests, and some R experiment.
