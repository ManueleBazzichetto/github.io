Welcome to my personal webpage (**still under construction** :hammer: )

My name is Manuele Bazzichetto, and I am a vegetation ecologist broadly interested in biological invasions, biogeography, species distribution modelling.

I come from Rome (Italy) and did all my studies there.

Here is a picture of me (when I had long hairs  :smile: ):

In this website, you will find some info about me and my research.

As soon as I can, I will share some contents related to R experiments. I love working with R and do things with it to test my understanding of statistical concepts.
