Following some pics taken in the field. It gets easier explaining about past experiences through good memories..

Here I was with my colleague (and friend) [**Marco Malavasi**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Malavasi) at a nice italian beach. We were taking images with a UAV E-bee to remotely derive topographic (e.g. elevation, slope and so on) and bio-related (e.g. NDVI) information.
My PhD thesis aimed at analysing the effect of natural and anthropogenic processes on coastal dune vegetation through the integration of field-collected floristic data and remotely sensed imagery.

See:
- [**How does dune morphology shape coastal EC habitats occurrence? A remote sensing approach using airborne LiDAR on the Mediterranean coast**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X16304435)

__Spoiler__: we used LiDAR imagery to describe the morphological profile of coastal plant communities listed in the European Community Habitats Directive.

- [**Multiple drivers of plant diversity in coastal dunes: A Mediterranean experience**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718341950)

__Spoiler__: we investigated which among human-related, abiotic and biotic factors mostly affect native species richness and cover on Mediterranean coastal dunes.


Since the second half of my PhD, I started working on biological invasions. My aim was to 1) use remote sensing data to derive measures of propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic factors, which are known to affect the outcome of any plant invasion event (see [___Catford et al., 2009___](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00521.x)) and 2) use this information to model the distribution of _Carpobrotus_ sp. on Mediterranean coastal dunes. Here a picture of this nice yet invasive plant, whcih is native to South Africa.
