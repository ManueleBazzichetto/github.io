Following, some pics taken in the field. Good memories are a perfect means to talk about past experiences..

![Me and Marco](images/IoeMarco_red.jpg)

In this picture, I am with [**Marco Malavasi**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Malavasi), colleague (and good friend). We were taking images with an eBee drone to remotely derive topographic (e.g. elevation, slope and so on) and bio-related (e.g. NDVI) information of a nice sandy beach in Italy.
At that time, it was already from a couple of years that I was working with remote sensing data for my PhD. Indeed, my thesis focused on the integration of field-collected floristic data and remotely sensed imagery to analyse the effects of natural and anthropogenic processes on coastal dune vegetation. My PhD supervisor was Prof. Carranza ([**University of Molise, EnvixLab**](http://envixlab.unimol.it/team/)), and my co-supervisor Prof. Acosta ([**University of Roma Tre**](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=mquEQS0AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=sra)).

Some results of the thesis:
- [**How does dune morphology shape coastal EC habitats occurrence? A remote sensing approach using airborne LiDAR on the Mediterranean coast**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X16304435)

__Spoiler__: we used LiDAR imagery to describe the morphological profile of coastal plant communities listed as EC-habitats in the European Community Habitats Directive.

- [**Multiple drivers of plant diversity in coastal dunes: A Mediterranean experience**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718341950)

__Spoiler__: we investigated which among human-related, abiotic and biotic factors mostly affect native species richness and cover on Mediterranean coastal dunes.

- [**Disentangling the effect of coastal erosion and accretion on plant communities of Mediterranean dune ecosystems**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272771420300251)

__Spoiler__: we explored the effect of shoreline dynamics (erosion and accretion) on dune vegetation diversity.

Half of the PhD focused on biological invasions. Specifically, my aim was to 1) use remote sensing data to derive measures of propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic factors, which are known to simultaneously affect the outcome of any invasion event (see [___Catford et al., 2009___](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00521.x) for a wonderful review) and 2) use the obtain information to model the distribution of _Carpobrotus_ sp. on Mediterranean coastal dunes. Here a picture of this nice yet invasive plant, whcih is native to South Africa.

People interested can read something here:

- [**Modeling plant invasion on Mediterranean coastal landscapes: An integrative approach using remotely sensed data**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204617302967)

__Spoiler__: we found out that wherever spots of bare ground are present along the coastal zonation, abiotic conditions are not too harsh and human presence is moderate _Carpobrotus_ sp. is there.

- [**Plant invasion risk: A quest for invasive species distribution modelling in managing protected areas**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305788)

__Spoiler__: we (humbly) proposed a species distribution model-based approach to prioritize management of invasive species in networks of protected areas.

After the PhD, I landed at Rennes (Bretagne, France). I worked on understanding what drives plant invasion in the harsh sub-Antarctic islands. In the picture, I am with a good friend of mine (Rémi Joly), who kindly carried me to cross a river on Possession Island (French sub-Antarctic islands). We were sampling alien species occurrence on the island.

One of the otucomes of this experience is here:

__Spoiler__: we found out that.....
